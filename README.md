November 6th, 2025. I am archiving this project to not delete it. Having it be here taking up a small digital space. The signification is that I tried, realized this wasn't how I wanted the page to be developed, and pivoted. 
It's not the mark of failure, but recognizing that moving on and starting over can be an option. No matter how many times it takes to get it right. 




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
